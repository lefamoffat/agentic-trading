ALWAYS use `uv` to run python commands. So instead of
```
python main.py
```
it should be
```
uv run main.py
```

The project-wide convention is to run Python with the `uv` wrapper **in every context** (local CLI usage, CI steps, docs, and commit messages). Direct `python â€¦` invocations are prohibited.
