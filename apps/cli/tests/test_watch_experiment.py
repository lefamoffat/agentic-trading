"""Regression test for CLI live watch error handling.

If the WebSocket handshake fails (e.g. API returns HTTP 500), the
``_watch_experiment`` helper should handle the exception internally and
exit gracefully without propagating errors to the caller.  Previously this
crashed the CLI with an ``InvalidStatus`` traceback.

This test patches the ``ws_connect`` helper to raise
``websockets.exceptions.InvalidStatus`` immediately, simulating the broken
handshake observed in manual testing.  The function is expected to catch
the exception, print a helpful message, and return normally.
