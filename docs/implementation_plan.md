# Implementation Plan

## feature template

TODO: define the pattern that should be used to describe what features should be used

Tasks:

-   Refactor scripts directory:
    -   Centralize market data logic into a full data-preparation pipeline and not just separate scripts.
-   Dashboard app
-   LLM driven training sessions. Already in place, so just testing and needs to be fully integrated, e.g. apps (cli, dashboard)
-   get docker replacement. docker is always causing issues with mlflow on mac laptop
-   implement CI/CD. pre-commit is already therre but not sure if it works.
