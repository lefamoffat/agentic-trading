# Implementation Plan

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Scripts Directory Refactoring (Phase 1 - COMPLETED)

**âœ… Market Data Centralization**

-   Implemented centralized `src/market_data/` module with unified interface
-   Created `prepare_training_data()` function replacing subprocess orchestration
-   Added intelligent caching and Qlib integration
-   Updated training scripts to use new market_data module

**âœ… Scripts Cleanup**

-   Removed deprecated `scripts/analysis/` directory (used for deprecated simulation app)
-   Updated `scripts/data/prepare_data.py` to use new market_data module
-   Updated `scripts/training/train_agent.py` to use centralized data preparation
-   Maintained single training script approach for RL agent orchestration

### Scripts Directory Refactoring (Phase 2 - COMPLETED)

**âœ… Training Script Optimization**

-   Updated `scripts/training/optimize_agent.py` to use new market_data module
-   Added missing `asyncio` import and async/await support for proper async function handling
-   Added `--days` parameter to match `train_agent_session()` function signature
-   Implemented proper async wrapper for Optuna optimization trials
-   All training scripts now follow consistent patterns and use centralized data preparation

### Dashboard Application (Phase 3 - COMPLETED)

**âœ… Multi-Page Dash Dashboard**

-   **Overview Page** (`/`): System status cards, recent experiments table, performance trends chart, top models leaderboard
-   **All Experiments** (`/experiments`): Filterable experiments table with search, comparison charts, MLflow integration
-   **Single Experiment** (`/experiment/{id}`): Detailed experiment analysis with metrics, parameters, and training progress
-   **Single Model** (`/model/{id}`): Model management with live trading controls, backtesting interface, model deployment
-   **Data Pipeline** (`/data-pipeline`): Data source monitoring, quality metrics, cache management, real-time status

**âœ… Technical Features**

-   Bootstrap-based responsive design with FontAwesome icons
-   Real-time auto-refresh intervals (15-30 seconds)
-   MLflow integration with graceful fallback to mock data
-   Interactive Plotly charts and tables with filtering/sorting
-   Error handling and graceful degradation
-   Launch script with configurable host, port, and debug options

## ðŸ“‹ Future Tasks
